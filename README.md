# How to Get Unbanned on Dark and Darker (2025 Guide) 🗝️

Getting banned from Dark and Darker can seriously harsh your dungeon crawl vibes, especially if you’re feeling it was totally undeserved. No worries! This straightforward guide will walk you through what to do if you’ve been banned and how to appeal your ban for the best shot at reclaiming your shadowy adventures.

## Maybe You Are HWID Banned? 🖥️

Did you get banned right after making a fresh character, or are bans popping up on all your accounts? You might be **HWID banned** (Hardware ID Ban)! This means Dark and Darker has clocked your PC’s hardware fingerprint, making it tricky to sneak back into the game even with a new account.

- Toxic, abusive, or harassing behavior  
- Account sharing, unauthorized trades, or suspicious actions
